L-systems.red is a tool for exploring the world of L-systems, inspired by http://www.kevs3d.co.uk/dev/lsystems/#

Most examples are taken from "Lindenmayer Systems, Fractals, and Plants", available at http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/lsfp.pdf

TruTiles
-
Pattern generator. it creates a grid of tiles (the 3 regular and another 6 semiregular tesselations og the plane) and renders each tile with a mix of 5 styles: 
- Tile: the outline of the tile
- Dual: lines from the centers of the edges to the center of the tile
- Diamond: lines connecting the centers of the edges
- Truchet: arcs connecting the edges two by two
- Diagonals: lines connecting the vertices of the tile and the center of the tile
